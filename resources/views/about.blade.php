    			<h4>Owner, Apricari</h4>
    			<p>My Name is Dian Kaye Ottinger. Iâ€™m a follower of Christ, single mother of 4, 
    			and a resident of San Antonio, Texas. I grew up watching my grandmother 
    			and mother sew on the old pedal Singer sewing machine. The idea of taking 
    			thread and material and creating a brand new piece that has never been seen 
    			inspired me to follow in their footsteps. I have made so many products, but I 
    			am beyond proud of the Apricari towel I designed and created all on my own. 
    			I love making people smile and my hope is that this product can help you take 
    			a break in your busy schedule to relax and enjoy some time to yourself.</p>
